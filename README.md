Node.js Tweet Aggregation Engine
================================

A web Application that allows the user to input a twitter query and collection name. 

All tweets available on the twitter API that pertain to the query are then stored in the collection. 

The tweets are unique and in chronological order. 

The web page signals to the user when the download is complete -> so that they can be used with an R client (_included_) connected to the database. 

The web app also supports historical tweets (although they are _much slower_) and an _untested_ twitter streamer. 

The web app allows the user to also collect all the user information for each unique user who posted a tweet within a collection. 

The web app displays the amount of data in each collection, and each collections unique indices. 

Web page blog also supports a _unique markdown plugin_. 

*Thorough testing* needs to be completed before the web application is production ready.
